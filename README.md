# Project New Haven Website

This is a website project that im currently making for a RedM Server that is upcoming later this year.

People that sees this CAN download and have a look at it to see the progress, however they are NOT allowed to edit as they see fit. 

This project is a play around project and is not going to be a fully fledged product in the end.

For any inquieries or allowance to play around feel free to contact myself per mail.
